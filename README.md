# mutation_selection
Simulation code used in Akdeniz and van Veelen (2023)

Matlab code used for the ultimatum game simulations in "Evolution and the Ultimatum Game" by Akdeniz and van Veelen. The model settings are described in Section 2 of the paper. The four Matlab files in this directory are listed and explained below.

Global_Co: Ultimatum game with global mutations
Local_Co: Ultimatum game with local and co-occurring mutations
Local_NotCo: Ultimatum game with local and independent mutations
Local_NotCo_Partial: Ultimatum game with local and independent mutations, and with (partial) observability

The code can be run directly on Matlab. The abstract of the paper can be found below.

Abstract: In this paper we review, upgrade, and synthesize existing models from evolutionary game theory, all of which aim at explaining human behaviour in the ultimatum game. Our new and improved versions of Gale et al. (1995), Nowak et al. (2000), and Rand et al. (2013) avoid shortcomings that the original versions have, one of which is that the results in the first and the last are driven by bias in the mutations. We also compare the predictions of these three models with the existing experimental evidence by looking at properties of the distributions of minimal acceptable offers. We find that the observed distributions do not conform to the predictions from Gale et al. (1995), Rand et al. (2013), or any other model in which there is no fitness benefit to rejecting. This does not rule out commitment-based explanations, such as Nowak et al. (2000).
